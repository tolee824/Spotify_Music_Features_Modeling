# Spotify Music Features Modeling Project


#### -- Project Status: [Completed] 

## Project Description
Spotify's API offers data regarding music features of songs (ex: tempo, popularity and duration) which can be used for modeling and hypothesis testing. Using a sample of 1000 records from the approximately 50,000 recordds, I wanted to:

* Determine if any of the music features of songs can help predict the popularity of a song using linear regression
* Check for a mean popularity difference between three genres (“Anime”, “Hip-Hop” and “Electronic”)
* Build a classification model that can determine if a Spotify is "Anime" genre


### Methods Used
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* ROC Curve
* Analysis of Variance ANOVA 
* Hypothesis Testing
* Tukey's Method


### Technologies 
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
