# Spotify Music Features Modeling Project

Spotify's API offers data regarding music features of songs (ex: tempo, popularity and duration) which can be used for modeling and hypothesis testing.

Using linear regression, I built a predictive model to determine a song's popularity

Using logistic regression, I built a classification model to identify whether a song belongs to a certain genre or not.   
  
Using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), I was able to test if there is a mean popularity difference between music genres.
